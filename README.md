### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**RobWalker-NYC/RobWalker-NYC** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

As a software engineer I am a fellow of Pursuit's full stack web development program: A 12-month, Google-funded software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate whose graduates have been hired as developers at leading companies such as Pinterest, JP Morgan, and Spotify.

I love tech, CES is my Comic-Con from hardware, gadgets and gizmos to software especially Java Script, HTML & CSS.

I'm a great fit for anyone looking for a team player, a tech geek, a food enthusiast, who is up for almost anything. I want to advocacy for community, and equality at companies like Netflix, Google, Apple or Hinge - companies with strong ethics, committed to their employees, community and the environment.
